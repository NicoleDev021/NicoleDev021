## About Me üöÄ

Analytics Engineer passionate about transforming data into actionable insights, with a special talent for bridging the gap between business needs and technical solutions. I excel at translating requirements and context from both sides, ensuring true understanding‚Äînot just collecting requirements, but connecting business goals with technical execution. 

This ability to speak both ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù and ‚Äútech‚Äù allows me to drive projects forward efficiently and collaboratively, even when others may not fully see the value of business-to-tech translation. While it‚Äôs not a formal class, it‚Äôs a crucial skill I bring to every team and project.

I specialize in **CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment)** and **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)** by serving as the Control Account Manager (CAM) for software in CI/CD pipelines. My role ensures that automated workflows are reliable, secure, and aligned with both technical requirements and business objectives, supporting seamless delivery and operational excellence.
